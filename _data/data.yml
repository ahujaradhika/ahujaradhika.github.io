    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
        I am a Math of Computation senior at UCLA. This past summer, I was a software engineering 
        intern at WeWork, as part of their Space Kit team devising algorithms to match spatial
        geometry of different types of rooms. I have also interned at startups before, and am 
        passionate about data journalism and writing outside of software engineering.
     
education:
    - degree: BSc in Math of Computation
      university: University of California, Los Angeles
      time: 2016 - 2020
      details: 
      
experiences:
    - role: Software Engineering Intern 
      time: June, 2019 - August, 2019
      company: WeWork, San Francisco
      details: |
         - Devised an algorithm in Go for comparison of spatial geometry of rooms to maintain 
         a stable database between new updates of data. 
         - Fine-tuned a threshold to give rooms a more human definition, i.e., included cases 
         with slight shifts in walls, beams or room placement.
         - Optimized the algorithm using goroutines after tracing using jaeger to reduce match 
         time per room. For an average of 50 rooms per floor, and thus ~2500 comparisons per 
         floor, optimizations brought down the average time by half from 60ms to 30ms.

    - role: Backend Intern
      time: January, 2019 - June, 2019
