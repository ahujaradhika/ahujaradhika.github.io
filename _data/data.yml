experiences:
    - role: Software Engineering Intern
      time: June, 2019 - August, 2019
      company: WeWork, San Francisco
      details: |
         - Devised an algorithm in Go for comparison of spatial geometry of rooms to maintain 
         a stable database between new updates of data. 
         - Fine-tuned a threshold to give rooms a more human definition, i.e., included cases 
         with slight shifts in walls, beams or room placement.
         - Optimized the algorithm using goroutines after tracing using jaeger to reduce match 
         time per room. For an average of 50 rooms per floor, and thus ~2500 comparisons per 
         floor, optimizations brought down the average time by half from 60ms to 30ms.
