description: "Implemented 4 versions of a basic Neural Network using Tensorflow to predict cab fares for every time bracket of the day with 4 different data cleaning methods, resulting in the best output of a Root Mean Squared Error of 2.7 among the 4, placing it in the top 5 Kaggle submissions among almost 1500 submissions."
